                            Fast delivery is also a major feature of us, because we produce both frames and lenses, this
                            allows us to seamlessly connect lens production and glasses assembly, with fast shipping and
                            we can even deliver progressive glasses within 7 working days.<br/><br/>
                            Assembly is not only lens cutting, but also frame shaping. Many companies do not pay
                            attention to this step, which leads to many after-sales problems. Every pair of glasses
                            assembled by Wohu Optical not only undergoes strict inspection, but also includes
                            professional glasses shaping.
